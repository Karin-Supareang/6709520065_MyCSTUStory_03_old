                <br>
                
                <p>Thought a various way, one is to invest in stocks market, if i wanted, it might take a long time to actually make me satisfied about the money i had made, so we go tridimensional way, working, but I'm a lazy person, working is like a tortured to my soul, so i want to work as minimum as i possibly can, so i introduce AI, A key factor to help me work, 
                    I use to be afraid that AI will took all my work as a people who wanted to work in technology market, but after a various research, i came to realise that, if i can use it, not only it won't harm me, it will only increase my productivity, here is how i use it and a little bit of my extra leaning plan.</p>

            <p class="reason">
                1. Write code for me, it may can write all code in the world, but cannot really replace a tech job that not solely relies on writing code, like SE that also requires to know how to make system as a whole working as efficient as possible, as well as, data scientist, front end/ backend developer ets.

            <p class="reason">
                2. Not just writing code but a repeatable task, i can just throw a prompt in and fix multiple of time and boom, a finish work.

                3. i will learning new languages cause AI is global things, new languages is only increase my chances to make more money.

                4. Leaning how to invest, with all that money, I don't want it to go down the drains, so i have to know how to use my money correctly too.

                5. Lastly, in the time it's can completely replace me as a people who work in technology market, i can just use a money that i invest in my 20s and my whole career to invest and make even more money through multiple ways that i have learned.
